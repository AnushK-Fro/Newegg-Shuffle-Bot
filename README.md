# Newegg Shuffle Bot (Proof of Concept)

This bot serves as a **Proof of Concept (PoC)** designed to automate the process of creating accounts and signing up for the Newegg Shuffle. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the feasibility of automating this process, although Newegg may detect and block such automation, which could affect the bot's functionality.

## Warning

This bot is likely detectable by Newegg’s security measures and may not function as intended. It is provided as a PoC for educational purposes.

## Usage

To use this bot, you will need a wildcard email setup. This allows the bot to generate multiple accounts automatically. 

Please note that the delays within the code may need to be adjusted based on your internet speed to optimize performance. This is an ongoing project, and further improvements may be required for stability and functionality.
